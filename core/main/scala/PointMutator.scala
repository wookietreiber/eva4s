/** Provides a mechanism for point mutation. It differs from [[Mutator]] in the aspect that it

  *
  * == Uses Cases ==
  *
  * - An [[Evolver]] may use point mutation just before recombination to provide more diversity.
  *
  * - point mutation may also be used to model external events / natural mutagens like gamma rays
  *
  * @tparam G the type of the genome of the individuals, represents a solution of the problem
  * @tparam P inut / problem type, represents the problem data structure
  *
  * @define NewMutantInfo The purpose of this method is the convenient creation of a new mutant. Use
  * it like the factory method of a case class. This method performs the mutation on its own, it is
  * not needed to do this in advance.
