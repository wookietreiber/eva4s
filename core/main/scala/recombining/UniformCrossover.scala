/** Uniform crossover randomly distributes genes between the offspring based on a fixed mixing

  *
  * The mixing ratio determines how the genes are distributed between the children, e.g.:
  *
  * - a value of zero will let the first child be equal to the first parent and the second child be
  *   equal to the second parent
  *
  * - a value of one will let the first child be equal to the second parent and the second child be
  *   equal to the first parent
  *
  * - a value of 0.5 (which is the default) will equally distribute the genes between the children,
  *   where each child will contain half of the genes of each parent
