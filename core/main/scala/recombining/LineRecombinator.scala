  *
  * The scaling argument determines how much around the parents the offspring will be. A value of
  * zero will constrain the offspring to the same dimensions as the parents. The default scaling
  * value is chosen to be 0.25 because it allows the offspring to be a little around the parents,
  * thus to vary a little bit more.
  *
  * @todo abstract over value type, currently only `Double`
