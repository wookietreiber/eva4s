/** An evolver that splits each generation into one part to be mutated and another part to be
  * recombined. This evolver picks always all new individuals for the next generation. This way the
  * population size always stays the same and there is no environmental selection involved in this
  * process. The chosen [[Mutagen]] determines the ratio of how many individuals recombine and how
  * many individuals mutate per generation, so the ratio should favor recombination because parental
  * selection is the driving force to improve the fitness.
  *
  * Since the recombination of two individuals has to produce another two individuals to keep the
  * population size the same you can use only [[recombining.CrossoverRecombinator]] with this
  * evolver.
