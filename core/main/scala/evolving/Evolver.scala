/** Executes an [[Evolutionary]] algorithm. An evolver is to an [[Evolutionary]] what an executor is
  * to a thread. How an [[Evolutionary]] is executed (sequential, parallel, distributed) depends on
  * the actual [[Evolver]] implementation.
  *
  * @note An [[Evolver]] implementation should be stateless.
  *
  * @see [[api]] contains default implementations.
  *
  * @define generations amount of generations until the fittest individual is chosen for as the
  * solution
  *
  * @define survivors amount of survivors per generation as well as initial population /
  * ancestors
  *
  * @define pairs amount of pairs generated per generation
  *
  * @define matchmaker determines, which parents reproduce new children
  *
  * @define mutagen chance of child to mutate as a function from current generation to a floating
  * point value between 0 and 1
  *
  * @define selector determines, how the individuals for the next generation are chosen
